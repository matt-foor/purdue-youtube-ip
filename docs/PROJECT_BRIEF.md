# Project Brief

## Problem Statement
Many small-to-mid-tier YouTube creators struggle to grow due to inefficient content strategies, lack of competitive intelligence, and minimal data-driven insights. While YouTube provides performance analytics for individual creators, there is a gap in cross-channel analysis and actionable strategic recommendations, especially in the ideation and planning phase.

**Key question:** Can we build a system that helps creators identify what type of content to produce based on public YouTube data and AI-assisted recommendations?

## Goal Statement
Design and prototype a solution that leverages publicly available YouTube metadata and LLMs to:
- Analyze trends across thousands of YouTube channels
- Identify content patterns that correlate with high engagement
- Generate channel-specific content strategy insights, including:
  - Recommended video topics
  - Suggested titles and thumbnails
  - Optimal posting frequency and length
  - Semantic themes that resonate with audiences

## Scope and Data
**Technologies and languages**
- Python for data collection, processing, and modeling
- YouTube Data API v3 for public video metadata and channel data
- BERTopic for topic modeling and semantic pattern extraction from video text
- GPT-4 API for content ideation, title generation, and strategic recommendations
- Streamlit for an interactive dashboard

**Key datasets**
- YouTube Data API v3: public metadata (titles, tags, view counts, likes, comments) from ~500-1000 channels across selected categories
- Google Trends (optional): correlate video topics with real-world search interest
- Public YouTube captions: NLP topic modeling input

## Deliverables
**Project outcomes**
- Internal slide deck and team presentation to project sponsors
- External short video for the Future Edelman Impact Award competition (if pursued)

**Documents and artifacts**
1. In-person or remote presentation for partner representatives with slide deck
2. Interactive dashboard where users enter a public channel name and receive insights
3. Code and config to reproduce results, shared with partner
4. Detailed project report:
   - Research conducted
   - Solution approach
   - Insights gained
   - Recommended model
   - Other recommendations or observations

## Expectations and Assumptions
**Purdue**
- A team of 5-6 M.S. BAIM students will work on the problem
- Sponsor provides data, data dictionary, and supporting materials via secure storage
- Instructor participates in kickoff and final review meetings
- Student team meets with sponsor regularly; instructor receives progress updates

**Sponsor**
- Project runs in agile sprints with at least bi-weekly updates
- Sponsor provides feedback and validates findings
- Sponsor reviews report/paper/poster and provides feedback within two weeks

**Students and Sponsor**
- Final presentation meeting scheduled at least two weeks prior to final week
