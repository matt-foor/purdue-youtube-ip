# YouTube IP V6

YouTube IP V6 is the current presentation-ready, Streamlit-deployable release. It carries forward the V5 product surface—seven sidebar destinations, public-only `Channel Insights`, bundled CSV benchmarking, and live YouTube / Gemini / OpenAI workflows—while refreshing the Streamlit entrypoint (`streamlit_app.py` → `dashboard/app.py`), built-in multipage navigation (`st.navigation`), dependency hardening (for example NumPy, PyArrow, and Google API client stacks on Windows and Cloud), and UI polish.

## At A Glance

| Metric | Current Count / State |
| --- | --- |
| Deployed versions documented here | `6` (`V1`–`V6`) |
| Live Streamlit app links (including historical) | `6` |
| Current V6 sidebar destinations | `7` |
| Current primary data paths | `2` |
| Current Channel Insights topic modes | `2` |
| Current live provider families | `3` (`YouTube`, `Gemini`, `OpenAI`) |
| Optional model-artifact path | `1` (`BERTopic` beta) |

## Current V6 In One Minute

- V6 keeps the same two core data paths as V5: bundled GitHub CSVs for benchmarking and live API pulls for channel, outlier, tool, and thumbnail workflows.
- `Channel Insights` remains public-only with two topic modes: default heuristics and optional BERTopic beta.
- `Thumbnails`, `Ytuber`, and `Tools` continue the creative and AI-assisted workflows from V5.
- V6 focuses on **reliable deployment**: explicit `run()` entry from `streamlit_app.py`, Streamlit’s **`st.navigation` / `pg.run()`** router, clearer dependency pins (`pyarrow`, `google-api-python-client`, `google-auth-httplib2`), and layout/CSS fixes for the global hero header.
- V5 already removed the V4 `Assistant` and Google OAuth owner overlays; V6 does not bring them back.

## Why This Project Exists

The original goal of the project was simple: help small-to-mid-sized YouTube creators make better content decisions with better intelligence than YouTube Studio alone provides. The early versions focused on public metadata, cross-channel benchmarking, semantic topic modeling, and AI-assisted recommendations so the team could answer questions like:

- What content themes actually perform across comparable channels?
- Which topics, formats, and publishing patterns correlate with stronger performance?
- How can a creator move from raw channel data to a usable action plan for titles, thumbnails, and next videos?

That core question stayed constant across every version. What changed was the way the app packaged the answer.

## What Survived Into V6

- Public-data-first creator intelligence stayed central from V1 onward.
- Bundled CSV benchmarking survived as `Channel Analysis`.
- Live public-channel analysis survived and matured into `Channel Insights`.
- AI-assisted creative generation survived through `Thumbnails` and `Ytuber`.
- Outlier research survived and remains a distinct workflow.
- Optional BERTopic topic modeling survived, but as a guarded beta path rather than a required dependency.
- Streamlit deployment remained the delivery surface for every released version.

## What We Tried And Later Removed Or Simplified

| Capability | Highest-Version Form | Why It Was Valuable | Why It Was Reduced Or Removed In V5 / Unchanged In V6 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sidebar `Assistant` | V4 | gave global help and retrieval-driven guidance across pages | added surface area, more maintenance, and more cognitive load than the lighter shell needed; still absent in V6 |
| Google OAuth + owner analytics overlay | V4 | enabled private metrics such as impressions, CTR, watch time, and retention | raised deploy complexity, secrets burden, and public-vs-owner workflow branching; still absent in V6 |
| Heavier mixed recommendation UI | V3 / V4 | combined strategy guidance with creative tooling | overlapped with `Channel Analysis` and `Channel Insights`; V5 narrows page 3 to `Thumbnails` (unchanged in V6) |
| Broader “everything page” behavior in earlier suites | V2 | useful during exploration and experimentation | harder to document and reason about than clearly separated workflows |
| Always-growing feature surface | V2-V4 | helped the team test many ideas quickly | eventually created duplication, deployment weight, and documentation drift |

## Current V6 Product Surface

The current V6 sidebar order is:

1. `Channel Analysis`
2. `Channel Insights`
3. `Thumbnails`
4. `Outlier Finder`
5. `Ytuber`
6. `Tools`
7. `Deployment`

This is the high-level page map. The detailed runtime handoffs for each page live in [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

In practice, V6 works as three layers:

- `Data`: bundled CSV benchmarking plus live provider/API calls
- `Service`: normalization, scoring, topic assignment, artifact prep
- `UI`: Streamlit cards, charts, tabs, downloads, and guided workflows

## Current Interactive Surfaces

These are the main interactive surfaces a user actually navigates once a page is open.

| Page | Surface Type | Count | Current Surfaces | What They Do |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Channel Analysis` | main analytics canvas | `1` | dataset filters + charts/tables | benchmark bundled CSV data |
| `Channel Insights` | tabs | `6` | `Overview`, `Topic Trends`, `Formats & Patterns`, `Outliers`, `Next Topics`, `History` | turn tracked public-channel snapshots into interpretable strategy signals |
| `Thumbnails` | tabs | `2` | `Generate`, `Download From URL` | create new thumbnails or export a public one |
| `Outlier Finder` | post-search sections | `4` | `Top Outliers In This Scan`, `Breakout Snapshot`, `AI Research`, `How This Works` | score breakout videos first, then interpret them |
| `Ytuber` | segmented modules | `8` | `AI Studio`, `Overview`, `Channel Audit`, `Keyword Intel`, `Outliers Finder`, `Title & SEO Lab`, `Competitor Benchmark`, `Content Planner` | open a live creator workspace around one channel |
| `Tools` | tabs | `3` | `Single`, `Batch`, `Playlist` | inspect and prepare public YouTube asset downloads |
| `Deployment` | in-app reference view | `1` | deployment/setup guidance | explain how to run and deploy the app |

    M2 --> M3["metrics + outliers + recommendations + snapshots"]

    L --> N["tables, charts, cards, downloads"]
    M3 --> N
```

The architecture resolves into three repeatable patterns:

- `Dataset path`: GitHub CSVs -> pandas transforms -> benchmark visuals
- `Live API path`: secrets/env -> provider clients -> normalized payloads -> interactive pages
- `Model path`: Channel Insights feature frame -> heuristic or BERTopic topics -> downstream metrics and recommendations

For the deeper page-by-page breakdown, see [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#page-problem-map).

    H --> I
    I --> J["pandas frames / scored payloads / artifact prep"]
    J --> K["Rendered Streamlit UI"]
```

This is the live V6 runtime path today:

- bundled CSVs power `Channel Analysis`
- live YouTube API calls power `Channel Insights`, `Outlier Finder`, `Ytuber`, `Tools`, and thumbnail URL export
- Gemini/OpenAI power thumbnail generation, AI Studio, and Outlier AI research
- the same secret names work in Streamlit secrets or GCP-style injected environment variables

For the deeper API/service explanation, see [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#api-data-pipeline-overview).

## Channel Insights: Where The Modeling Actually Lives

`Channel Insights` is where the most advanced modeling work lands in V5/V6. Every refresh starts with the same public-channel workspace, then branches into one of two topic assignment modes:

- `Heuristic Topics`
  - default mode
  - built from title, tags, and description tokenization
  - always available
- `Model-Backed Topics (Beta)`
  - optional BERTopic semantic grouping
  - activated only when beta mode is selected and the model manifest/artifact path is configured
  - falls back to heuristics if anything fails

Deployment notes in one screen:

- V6 stays **public-only** for `Channel Insights` (same as V5)
- the app reads `st.secrets` first, then environment variables
- BERTopic beta only activates when `MODEL_ARTIFACTS_ENABLED=true` and the manifest URL is configured
- the GCP-oriented env template is [`.env.gcp.example`](.env.gcp.example), which is meant to be copied into Cloud Run, GCE, or Secret Manager-backed environment configuration rather than committed as a real secret file

For the full deployment matrix and secrets history, see [Deployment And Versions](docs/DEPLOYMENT_AND_VERSIONS.md).

## Project Brief And Evolution Summary

The short version of the project story is:

- `V1` proved the public-data analytics and recommendation concept
- `V2` expanded into a broader creator operating system
- `V3` clarified the product shell and runtime structure
- `V4` added the deepest intelligence layer with `Channel Insights`, Assistant, Google OAuth, and BERTopic beta
- `V5` kept the strongest workflows, removed the heaviest operational complexity, and documented the system clearly for presentation and deployment
- `V6` is the **current** Streamlit release: same V5 capabilities, with a hardened router, dependencies, and deployment path ([live app](https://ip-youtube-creator-insight-2026.streamlit.app/))

What V5 removed on purpose (still true in V6):

- sidebar `Assistant`
- Google OAuth and owner-only analytics overlays
- heavier mixed recommendation behavior on page 3

What V5 kept on purpose (still true in V6):

- dataset benchmarking
- public tracked-channel insights
- thumbnail generation and export
- outlier research
- the live `Ytuber` workspace
- optional BERTopic beta modeling

What V6 adds on top of V5:

- dependable **local and Cloud** runs (correct Python wheels, PyArrow, Google client stack)
- **Streamlit-native multipage** navigation and a single **`run()`** entry from `streamlit_app.py` so every rerun executes the router

For the full narrative brief and retrospective, see [Project Brief](docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md).

- [Project Brief](docs/PROJECT_BRIEF.md) for the narrative project story, original goals, what changed, and how V5 led to V6

## Ethics And Operating Principles

The original V1 principles still apply in V6:

- use public data responsibly
- respect provider terms of service
- avoid exposing personal data
- prefer explainable insights over black-box claims
- make AI-generated outputs additive to analysis, not a replacement for it

## Local Run

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
